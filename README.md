# 🕵️‍♂️ Keylogger using Python

This project demonstrates the inner workings of a **Python-based keylogger**, developed for **educational and ethical cybersecurity research**. As part of my learning journey into malware analysis and behavior-based threat detection, this tool helps simulate basic keylogging techniques in a controlled, isolated environment.

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**  
> This project is **strictly for ethical and educational purposes**. Unauthorized or malicious use of keyloggers is **illegal** and **unethical**. Always ensure proper consent when testing and use only in safe environments like sandboxes or virtual machines.

## 💡 Project Overview

This tool captures keyboard input and logs it to a file, simulating how basic keyloggers operate. It helps reinforce how such tools can be detected, analyzed, and defended against in real-world scenarios. The goal is to gain a **deep understanding of keylogging behavior** to build more secure systems.
